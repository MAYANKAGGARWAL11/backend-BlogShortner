Default Route (/):

Method: GET
Description: Renders the default home page with the title "Express."
URL Shortening Route (/url/:url):

Method: POST
Description: Accepts a URL in the request parameters, generates a short ID, and stores the association between the short ID and the original URL in the database. Returns the generated short ID in the response. Handles errors and sends a 400 status if the URL is missing or a 500 status for internal server errors.
URL Redirection Route (/url/:shortID):

Method: GET
Description: Accepts a short ID in the request parameters, looks up the associated original URL in the database, and redirects the client to the original URL. Handles errors and sends a 400 status if the short ID is missing, a 404 status if the short URL is not found, and a 500 status for internal server errors.
The code assumes the existence of a userModel that interacts with a database to store the mapping between short IDs and original URLs. The generateShortID function is used to create a random short ID of a specified length. Additionally, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled for all routes using the cors middleware.
